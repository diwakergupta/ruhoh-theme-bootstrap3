ruhoh-theme-bootstrap3
======================

A basic ruhoh theme using Twitter's Bootstrap v3. I used
[theme-bootstrap-2](https://github.com/ruhoh/theme-bootstrap-2) as a starting
point and updated it to use bootstrap v3's HTML markup and CSS classes.

Comments and patches welcome! If you end up using this theme, please consider
linking back and do let me know so I may include it here :)
